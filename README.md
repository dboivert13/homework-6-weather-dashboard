# homework-6-weather-dashboard

In the sixth homework assignment with the Georgia Tech Web Development bootcamp I was tasked with creating an application from scratch that displayed the weather of various cities around the world. Using the OpenWeather API, I would need to retrieve weather data that would run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The requirements and acceptance criteria are as follows:

# User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast

# The Approach:
This assignment was very challenging for me to say the least. Creating the HTML and CSS (things I feel very comfortable with now) was the first thing I did to boost my confidence towards tackling this task. Before starting on any javaScripts I worked my way thru the OpenWeather API documentation. From there, creating an API key and storing it in a variable was step number two. This project forced us to work with writing jQuery AJAX calls, and using third-party API's. Two of the hardest parts of this was concatenating my API key and storing them in variables for more easy access (kept doing it wrong initially), and using local storage. With the help of some classmates I was able to reach my M.V.P. a little before the assignment was due. I am planning on doing this assignment over again as there are a lot of points that I need to go over to really hammer it all home.
